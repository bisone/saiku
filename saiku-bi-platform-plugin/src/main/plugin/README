Saiku Analytics - Pentaho BI-Server Plugin
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the Plugin version of the Saiku Analytics application.
It allows you to create, manipulate and save/load queries like in the standalone version,
but also fully integrates in the Pentaho BI-Server.

This means you can save and load queries directly into the Pentaho Solution Repository.


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CONFIGURATION
------------------------------------------------------------------
There exist a configuration file within the plugin folder that allows you to specify the user, password and base-url
of the saiku Web-application. If you change the name of the webapplication or user details 
in the saiku-webapplication, you need to adapt this configuration accordingly. (You can change the default users in: tomcat/webapps/saiku/WEB-INF/users.properties)

The configuration file of the plugin lies in pentaho-solutions/system/saiku/config/config.json and looks like this:
{
	"username": "admin", 		// username used to connect to the saiku webapplication (REST Service)
  	"password": "admin",		// password - " -
    "saiku-webapp": "/saiku/", 	// name of the REST web application (WAR) you have deployed nex t pentaho
    "saiku-ui-base" : "/pentaho/content/saiku-ui/", // DON'T CHANGE THIS. this is the base of the saiku user interface, you only need to change this URL if you change the name of the pentaho webapplication)
    "plugin":"true" // DON'T CHANGE THIS. This is the information for the UI that its being used as plugin integrated in another web application.
}


QUERY FILES:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Those files have the same format as in the Saiku standalone Web-Application. 
This means if you access the standalone version of saiku via e.g. http://localhost:8080/saiku/ and save queries
there, you can re-use the same queries in the solution repository and vice-versa.

The query files of the standalone version are stored in something equivalent to: 
	tomcat/webapps/saiku/WEB-INF/classes/saiku-repository

The query files of the plugin are somewhere stored in your pentaho solution repository:
	biserver-ce/pentaho-solutions/......
	
The files in there
